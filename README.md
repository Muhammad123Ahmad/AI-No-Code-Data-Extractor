# AI-No-Code-Data-Extractor
AI No-Code Data Extractor is an n8n workflow that uses OpenAI to generate, structure, and export AI responses into Excel automatically.

You can ask questions like “What are the top 5 no-code platforms?”, and the workflow:

Sends the prompt to an AI model (via OpenAI API).

Transforms the unstructured text into clean tabular JSON.

Automatically splits fields like name, release date, url, description, features, and more.

Saves the results into an Excel or Google Sheet — fully automated.

This project is ideal for building AI-driven research sheets, market comparison tables, and structured data collection tools — all without coding.
